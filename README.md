This was my very first programming project on my own.
The idea was to replicate an old-school console-input based pure text adventure game. 

Originally I wrote it as a C# desktop application but later when I switched to web development and felt comfortable with JavaScript and React, I was curious if I could re-make it as a web application with the addition of some basic graphical interface.

So I tried to make it with React and this is the result so far:

Please note that this is an ongoing project as there is always something to improve.
It is not optimized for smaller screen sizes and currently not planning it either. (I feel like there is no point wasting time with it as of now, maybe in the future...)


Here are some ideas that i plan to implement in the future:
-a simple Save/Load system with the use of LocalStorage
-balancing things (XP gain, enemy health)
-extending the story and give it a proper ending (it ends way to quickly in a fairly unsatisfying way)
-making more in-depth choices
-more class identity to really feel like they are different (not just a few choices and character stat difference)
